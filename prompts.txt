📋 HIVE MIND EXECUTION PROTOCOL:

As the Queen coordinator, you must:

1. **INITIALIZE THE HIVE** (CRITICAL: Use Claude Code's Task Tool for Agents):
   
   Step 1: Optional MCP Coordination Setup (Single Message):
   [MCP Tools - Coordination Only]:
      mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { "type": "researcher", "count": 1 }
   mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { "type": "coder", "count": 1 }
   mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { "type": "analyst", "count": 1 }
   mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn { "type": "tester", "count": 1 }
   mcp__claude-flow__memory_store { "key": "hive/objective", "value": "Read brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md and 
implement phases 1,2 and 3 as described and test using BDD GWT structured PyTest. Use Neo4j as documented in 
NEO4J_SETUP.md, maintain a detailed context block comment at the start of every code file. Finally update README.md to
 describe what was done and push everything to github" }
   mcp__claude-flow__memory_store { "key": "hive/queen", "value": "strategic" }
   mcp__claude-flow__swarm_think { "topic": "initial_strategy" }
   
   Step 2: REQUIRED - Spawn ACTUAL Agents with Claude Code's Task Tool (Single Message):
   [Claude Code Task Tool - CONCURRENT Agent Execution]:
      Task("Researcher Agent", "You are a researcher in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Conduct thorough research 
using WebSearch and WebFetch", "researcher")
   Task("Coder Agent", "You are a coder in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Write clean, maintainable, 
well-documented code", "coder")
   Task("Analyst Agent", "You are a analyst in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Analyze data patterns and trends", 
"analyst")
   Task("Tester Agent", "You are a tester in the hive. Coordinate via hooks. - Design comprehensive test strategies", 
"tester")
   
   Step 3: Batch ALL Todos Together (Single TodoWrite Call):
   TodoWrite { "todos": [
     { "id": "1", "content": "Initialize hive mind collective", "status": "in_progress", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "2", "content": "Establish consensus protocols", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "3", "content": "Distribute initial tasks to workers", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "4", "content": "Set up collective memory", "status": "pending", "priority": "high" },
     { "id": "5", "content": "Monitor worker health", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium" },
     { "id": "6", "content": "Aggregate worker outputs", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium" },
     { "id": "7", "content": "Learn from patterns", "status": "pending", "priority": "low" },
     { "id": "8", "content": "Optimize performance", "status": "pending", "priority": "low" }
   ] }

2. **ESTABLISH COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE**:
   - Use consensus_vote for major decisions
   - Share all discoveries via memory_share
   - Synchronize learning with neural_sync
   - Coordinate strategy with swarm_think

3. **QUEEN LEADERSHIP PATTERNS**:
   
   - Focus on high-level planning and coordination
   - Delegate implementation details to workers
   - Monitor overall progress and adjust strategy
   - Make executive decisions when consensus fails
   
   

4. **WORKER COORDINATION**:
   - Spawn workers based on task requirements
   - Assign tasks according to worker specializations
   - Enable peer-to-peer communication for collaboration
   - Monitor and rebalance workloads as needed

5. **CONSENSUS MECHANISMS**:
   - Decisions require >50% worker agreement
   
   
   

6. **COLLECTIVE MEMORY**:
   - Store all important decisions in shared memory
   - Tag memories with worker IDs and timestamps
   - Use memory namespaces: hive/, queen/, workers/, tasks/
   - Implement memory consensus for critical data

7. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**:
   - Monitor swarm metrics continuously
   - Identify and resolve bottlenecks
   - Train neural networks on successful patterns
   - Scale worker count based on workload

💡 HIVE MIND BEST PRACTICES:

✅ ALWAYS use BatchTool for parallel operations
✅ Store decisions in collective memory immediately
✅ Use consensus for critical path decisions
✅ Monitor worker health and reassign if needed
✅ Learn from failures and adapt strategies
✅ Maintain constant inter-agent communication
✅ Aggregate results before final delivery

❌ NEVER make unilateral decisions without consensus
❌ NEVER let workers operate in isolation
❌ NEVER ignore performance metrics
❌ NEVER skip memory synchronization
❌ NEVER abandon failing workers

🎯 OBJECTIVE EXECUTION STRATEGY:

For the objective: "Read brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md and implement phases 1,2 and 3 as described and test using BDD 
GWT structured PyTest. Use Neo4j as documented in NEO4J_SETUP.md, maintain a detailed context block comment at the 
start of every code file. Finally update README.md to describe what was done and push everything to github"

1. Break down into major phases using swarm_think
2. Create specialized worker teams for each phase
3. Establish success criteria and checkpoints
4. Implement feedback loops and adaptation
5. Aggregate and synthesize all worker outputs
6. Deliver comprehensive solution with consensus

⚡ CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION WITH CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL:

The Hive Mind MUST use Claude Code's Task tool for actual agent execution:

✅ CORRECT Pattern:
[Single Message - All Agents Spawned Concurrently]:
  Task("Researcher", "Research patterns and best practices...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester", "Create comprehensive tests...", "tester")
  Task("Analyst", "Analyze performance metrics...", "analyst")
  TodoWrite { todos: [8-10 todos ALL in ONE call] }

❌ WRONG Pattern:
Message 1: Task("agent1", ...)
Message 2: Task("agent2", ...)
Message 3: TodoWrite { single todo }
// This breaks parallel coordination!

Remember:
- Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn ALL agents in ONE message
- MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup, not agent execution
- Batch ALL TodoWrite operations (5-10+ todos minimum)
- Execute ALL file operations concurrently
- Store multiple memories simultaneously

🚀 BEGIN HIVE MIND EXECUTION:

Initialize the swarm now with the configuration above. Use your collective intelligence to solve the objective 
efficiently. The Queen must coordinate, workers must collaborate, and the hive must think as one.

Remember: You are not just coordinating agents - you are orchestrating a collective intelligence that is greater than 
the sum of its parts. 

● 🧠 HIVE MIND INITIALIZATION

  I am the Queen coordinator of the Hive Mind collective. Let me begin by reading the required documentation files to understand the full scope of our objective.

● Read(brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md)
  ⎿  Read 391 lines

● Read(NEO4J_SETUP.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Search(pattern: "**/*")
  ⎿  Found 100 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● I see there's no NEO4J_SETUP.md file yet - I need to understand the Neo4j requirements. Let me also check the README and sample data to fully understand the project scope.

● Read(README.md)
  ⎿  Read 26 lines

● Read(data/kaggle/Brasileirao_Matches.csv)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

● Read(data/kaggle/fifa_data.csv)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

● Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project. Since there's no NEO4J_SETUP.md file yet, I'll need to create it as part of the implementation. Let me analyze the specification document to identify the 3 phases to implement.

  Based on the brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md, I can identify the implementation phases:
  - Phase 1: Data Layer - Load and normalize all 6 CSV datasets
  - Phase 2: Query Engine - Implement match, team, player, and statistical queries
  - Phase 3: Neo4j Knowledge Graph - Create graph database schema and relationships

  Let me now initialize the Hive Mind and begin concurrent execution with all agents.
